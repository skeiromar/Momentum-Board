# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added `cypress/e2e/layout/footer-position.cy.ts` to verify the footer remains pinned to the viewport bottom on short pages.
- Added Simplified Chinese (`zh`) locale support across the client i18n provider, language switcher, locale dictionaries, and i18n key validation.
- Added a combined policy-writing guide page at `/policies` plus a maintenance SOP in `skills/policy-guide/SKILL.md`.
- Added a config-driven redirect system in `src/server/config/redirects.ts` with middleware integration and E2E coverage (`cypress/e2e/routing/redirects.cy.ts`).
- Added redirect documentation in `docs/REDIRECTS.md` and a reusable agent SOP at `skills/add-redirect/SKILL.md`.

### Changed
- Updated `PageLayout` to use a full-height flex column so the footer consistently sits at the bottom of the viewport.
- Replaced separate Terms/Privacy footer links with a single policy guide link and routed legacy `/privacy` and `/terms` paths to `/policies`.
- Refined testing guidance across `AGENTS.md`, `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `cypress/README.md` to keep E2E contract coverage lean and migration-friendly while still requiring feature-level automated tests at the right layer.
- Simplified `cypress/e2e/seo/page-meta.cy.ts` to assert core metadata contracts without over-coupling to every page-specific metadata field.
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security
- Added IP-based rate limiting for `POST /login/password` with configurable env overrides (`LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`).

+ Added React 19 meta tags.
+ Added ScrollToTop functionality on route change.
+ Added a shared `PageTransition` component in `src/client/ui/components/page-transition.tsx`, integrated through `PageLayout` so route transitions apply across all pages.
