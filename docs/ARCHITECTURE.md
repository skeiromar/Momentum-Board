# Architecture

## Overview

2026 Boilerplate is a full-stack TypeScript web application with a React frontend and Express backend served together via `vite-express`. There is no database — authentication uses a hardcoded test user and state persists to encrypted `localStorage`.

## System Diagram

```
Browser
  │
  ├── React SPA (Vite HMR in dev)
  │     ├── Pages (lazy-loaded via React Router)
  │     ├── Redux Store (preferences, app slices)
  │     │     └── Persistence Middleware → Encrypted localStorage
  │     └── Chakra UI Components
  │
  └── HTTP requests
        │
        ▼
Express Server (vite-express)
  ├── Auth Routes (/api/session + legacy /login/password, /logout) → Passport.js LocalStrategy
  ├── API Routes (/api/key) → Returns encryption key
  ├── Redirect Rules (legacy paths) → Config-driven HTTP redirects
  ├── Page Routes (/, /login, /product, etc.) → Served by Vite
  └── Static Routes (/sitemap.xml)
```

## Key Patterns

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials to `POST /login/password`
2. Passport.js `LocalStrategy` verifies against the hardcoded user
3. On success: JWT cookie (`token`) is set, redirect to `/product`
4. On failure: redirect back to `/login`
5. Protected routes use `ensureAuthenticated` middleware

### State Persistence Flow

1. On app load, `initPreferences` async thunk fetches encryption key from `/api/key`
2. If authenticated, the key is returned and used to decrypt `localStorage`
3. On every Redux action, the persistence middleware encrypts and saves specified slices
4. The persistence middleware in `store.ts` is reusable — add persistence registrations for slices, don't create new middleware

### UI failure/latency boundaries

- App-level catastrophic failure handling is managed by `ErrorBoundary` in `src/client/main.tsx`.
- Route-level latency is managed by `Suspense` around lazy routes in `src/client/App.tsx`.
- Feature-level failures should use local boundaries when one section can fail independently (example: product counter actions).
- Feature-level latency should use local `Suspense` only for independently-loading sections, not whole-page wrappers.
- Use React 19 `Activity` around loading fallback UI when representing active pending work.

### Client/Server Code Separation

The client uses `src/client/utilities/` for browser-specific helpers. Server helpers live in `src/server/services/` and `src/server/config/`. Keep client-only and server-only modules separated to avoid accidental cross-runtime imports.

## Technology Choices

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Build | Vite | Fast HMR, ESM-native, simple config |
| Frontend | React 19 | Document metadata, hooks, Suspense |
| State | Redux Toolkit | DevTools, middleware, battle-tested at scale |
| Routing | React Router | Lazy loading, client-side navigation |
| UI | Chakra UI | Accessible, composable, good TypeScript support |
| Backend | Express 5 | Flexible, mature, large ecosystem |
| Auth | Passport.js | Strategy-based, extensible |
| Encryption | Native Web Crypto API | AES-GCM encryption for localStorage |
| Testing | Cypress | E2E testing with interactive runner |
| Linting | ESLint | Custom config with TypeScript + React rules |
